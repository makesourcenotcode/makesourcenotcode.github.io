<body><h1>Freedom Respecting Technology: the Next Generation of Open Source, Free Software, Open Knowledge, Open Culture, and Technological Freedom</h1>
<h2>Welcome to the home of the Freedom Respecting Technology Initiative!</h2>
<p>Truly open knowledge and true technological freedom fundamentally require trivial ease in fully and cleanly copying allegedly open digital works in forms useful for offline study.</p>
<p>For example, in the case of software, the overly narrow focus on easy access to the main program sources isn't enough. Trivial access to offline documentation, for any official documentation that may exist, is critical. Needing a constant network connection to study something claiming to be open isn't freedom. Needing the site hosting an allegedly open work to always be up isn't freedom.</p>
<ul><li>Read/download the current version of the Freedom Respecting Technology Definition in your formats of choice.</li>
<li>PDF is recommended for the best reading experience.</li>
<li>Please share with all potentially interested parties.</li>
<li>Keep an eye out for the FRT demos coming soon and feel the difference hands on.</li></ul>

<h2>Other lesser known movements with good ideas</h2>
We don't necessarily totally agree with all their ideas. If we did we'd just back them instead of also doing our own thing and pointlessly increasing fragmentation. That said all of these other movements are also trying to fix real problems with the technological status quo. Thus we endorse them and mention them here because they deserve serious study, consideration, and support.
