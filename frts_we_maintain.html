<body><h1>FRTs Maintained By Us</h1>
<p>These are all small but complete FRTs that solve real problems we have had.</p>
<p>Even if somewhat niche, these tools are in our opinion best in class solutions to the problems motivating their existence. Don't believe us? Research alternatives. You'll usually find either either a) nothing, b) tools with less features, or c) tools with showstopping bugs.</p>
<p>Larger demonstrations of FRT principles at scale will be added later.</p>

<dd>Brings package management with Zypper into the 21st Century by providing an autoremove command as well as facilities for marking package installation reasons as automatic or manual.</dd>
<dt><a href="https://github.com/makesourcenotcode/name-safe-in-bash">name-safe-in-bash</a></dt>
<dd>Help choosing Bash alias and function names that WON'T come back to bite you later! Given both how short most Unix commands are and how many of them there are frequent command line users are one typo away from executing an unintended command. The consequences of this range from minor annoyances to major data loss. The problem is only partially solvable as we don't control the names of commands mandated by standards like POSIX. But this tool can still alert about suboptimal alias, function, and executable names you choose.</dd>
